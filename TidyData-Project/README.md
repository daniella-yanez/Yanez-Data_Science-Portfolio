When inspecting the data, we see that there are 70 columns, not including the name column, for specific sports divided by men's and women's sports. This is one aspect that makes this dataset unreadable. 

Another factor is that there are only three potential medals: gold, silver, and bronze. However, due to the unmanageable amount of columns, keeping track of the gold, silver, or bronze medals should be easier.

Any possible question about the medalists is tackled by the insane mess of this dataset that makes finding any information for an individual, a sport, or a medal hard to find.
Below is an example of how with 30 rows and 4 columns, we only learn about 3 medals given. Absolute Chaos.
