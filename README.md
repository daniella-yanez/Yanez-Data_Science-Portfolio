# Yanez-Data-Science-Portfolio


## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my coding projects, highlighting my skills in **data analysis, visualization, and research**. Each project is designed to strengthen my ability to handle real-world data challenges.  

## [New Project: Tidy Data Project ](https://github.com/daniella-yanez/TidyData-Project)

**_Project Overview_**

This project involves cleaning and reshaping Olympic medalist data from the 2008 Olympics. It demonstrates my ability to:

- Convert raw, unstructured data into a tidy format for better analysis.
- Use Pandas for efficient data manipulation.
- Apply data visualization techniques to extract insights.
**Title**
Tidy Data Project → (Data Cleaning & Visualization using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib)

**How This Project Complements My Portfolio**
Reinforces data cleaning skills by restructuring messy datasets.
Enhances data storytelling through clear visualizations.

## [Machine Learning App – Streamlit Deployment](https://github.com/daniella-yanez/Yanez-Data_Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp)

**_Project Overview_**

This project is an interactive Streamlit web application that allows users to upload datasets, select and train supervised machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or K-Nearest Neighbors), and view performance results like accuracy, classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC curves. Users can also adjust model hyperparameters and see how these changes affect model outcomes in real-time.

This app deepened my understanding of supervised learning workflows, feature scaling, and evaluation metrics. It also gave me hands-on experience with interactive Python development and deploying a machine learning model via Streamlit Community Cloud.

**How This Project Complements My Portfolio**
- Python Proficiency: Demonstrates ability to use key libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and Streamlit.

- Machine Learning: Shows end-to-end application of classification models with user-driven training/testing and evaluation.

- Web Deployment: First full deployment of an interactive Python app, extending beyond notebooks and into shareable interfaces.

- User-Focused Design: Emphasizes clarity of results, thoughtful layout, and interpretation to make ML accessible to any user.
