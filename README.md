## [Tidy Data ProjectðŸ”—](https://github.com/daniella-yanez/Yanez-Data_Science-Portfolio/tree/7a3ab095e865df407cda39b79a3d1b92b8b242d7/TidyData-Project)

### **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on cleaning and reshaping Olympic medalist data from the 2008 Summer Olympics. The dataset, initially in an untidy format, was transformed into a **tidy format** using **Pandas** and visualized with **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**. Key tasks involved:
- **Reshaping the data**: Using `pandas.melt()` to convert columns into variables for better analysis.
- **Data cleaning**: Removing duplicates and handling missing values.
- **Categorization**: Converting medals into an ordered categorical variable for easier analysis.

### **Key Techniques and Tools Used**  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for data visualization  
- **Data Transformation** using `.melt()`  
- **Categorization** of medal types  

### **How This Project Complements My Portfolio**  
- **Data Cleaning**: Demonstrates the ability to clean, structure, and transform raw data into a usable format.
- **Visualization**: Shows proficiency in creating insightful visualizations to explore Olympic medal distributions.
- **Tidy Data Principles**: Reinforces the concept of tidy data for reproducible and scalable analysis.
