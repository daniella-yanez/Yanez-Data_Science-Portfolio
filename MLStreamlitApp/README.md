# Machine Learning Playground: Train Your Own Model with Streamlit


## Project Overview and Purpose
This web app was built with Streamlit to make supervised machine learning accessible, visual, and intuitive â€” even if you donâ€™t know how to code. Whether you're a beginner exploring ML concepts or just want a fast way to prototype models, this tool lets you:

You can upload your own CSV file or use classic datasets provided, then experiment with different models and hyperparameters to see how they perform.

- Upload your own dataset *or* choose from classic built-in ones like **Option 1**, **Option 2**, or **option 3**
- Train models like **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, or **K-Nearest Neighbors**
- Tune hyperparameters interactively with sliders and dropdowns
- Visualize model performance with metrics, confusion matrices, and ROC curves

---

## Features

- âœ… Upload your own CSV or try out classic classification datasets  
- âœ… Choose from 3 supervised ML models  
- âœ… Tune hyperparameters directly in the sidebar  
- âœ… View model metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score  
- âœ… Interactive charts: Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and more  
- âœ… Clean layout using Streamlit expanders and tabs for easy navigation

## Visuals
### [1. Interface Example](ML_Playground_Interface.png)
This screenshot shows the clean, interactive interface of the Machine Learning Explorer app. It includes:
- A preview of the uploaded dataset
- Automatically detected column types
- An overview of the target variable's distribution
  
### [Dataset Overview Example](Data_Overview_Example.png)
This screenshot displays the top of the interface, showing:
- The uploaded dataset (Iris dataset in this example)
- A dynamic preview of feature columns and the target variable  

### [Results Interpretation Example](Results_Interpretation_Example.png)
This section explains what the model results mean in plain language:
- Summary of model accuracy
- Bullet points interpreting the confusion matrix and classification report
- Suggested next steps for users to refine their model
