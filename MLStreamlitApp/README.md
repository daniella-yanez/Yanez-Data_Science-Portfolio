# Machine Learning Playground: Train Your Own Model with Streamlit

## Project Overview and Purpose
This web app was built with Streamlit to make supervised machine learning accessible, visual, and intuitive â€” even if you donâ€™t know how to code. Whether you're a beginner exploring ML concepts or just want a fast way to prototype models, this tool lets you:

You can upload your own CSV file or use classic datasets provided, then experiment with different models and hyperparameters to see how they perform.

- Upload your own dataset *or* choose from classic built-in ones like **Option 1**, **Option 2**, or **option 3**
- Train models like **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, or **K-Nearest Neighbors**
- Tune hyperparameters interactively with sliders and dropdowns
- Visualize model performance with metrics, confusion matrices, and ROC curves

## App Features
### Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression âœ…
  - Adjust regularization strength **(C)**
  - Choose **penalty** (L1, L2) and **solver** (liblinear, saga, etc.)
  - Visualize performance with confusion matrix and ROC curve

- Decision Tree âœ…
  - Set **maximum depth** of the tree
  - Choose **criterion** (gini or entropy)
  - Adjust **minimum samples split**

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) âœ…
  - Choose **number of neighbors** (k)
  - Select **weighting method** (uniform or distance)
  - Set **distance metric** (euclidean, manhattan, etc.)

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Each model offers dynamic sidebar controls using sliders and dropdowns to:
  - Customize model behavior (e.g., number of neighbors, depth, regularization)
  - Instantly retrain and update performance metrics
  - Optimize performance based on user-selected parameters
